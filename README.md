With these code, PWM signal will be sent from PC to BLDC Motor (or something else) via an Arduino Uno board.

MOTORpwmGUI.py will send pwm value to Arduino.  
PCArduinoPWM.ino will get the signal and write it to the connected MOTOR (pin 6)

The executable file from MOTORpwmGUI.py is MOTORpwmGUI.exe
